== Solution to @exer-mf-1 (cube roots)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-1>)

We'll just find all the answers to $z^3 = -1000 i$
as in @sec-recipe-complex-nth-root and then identify the relevant one.
In polar form, write
$ z^3 = - 1000 i = 1000 dot (cos 270 degree + i sin 270 degree). $
Take the cube roots with the standard recipe:
the magnitudes should be $root(3, 1000) = 10$
and the arguments should start from $(270 degree) / 3 = 90 degree$
and be spaced $120 degree$ apart.
That is, the three cube roots should be
$ z_1 &= 10 (cos 90 degree + i sin 90 degree) \
  z_2 &= 10 (cos 210 degree + i sin 210 degree) \
  z_3 &= 10 (cos 330 degree + i sin 330 degree). $

Of these three answers, we want the one
whose real and imaginary part are both negative.
Only $z_2$ works; in rectangular form it is
$ z_2 = 10 (- sqrt(3) / 2 - i 1 / 2) = #boxed[$ - 5sqrt(3) - 5 i $] $
(and this is the only possible example).

== Solution to @exer-mf-2 (one of two eigenvalues)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-2>)

#h3[Solution with bare-hands]

Given that $2$ is an eigenvalue of $M$,
we should have $det (M - 2 I) = 0$.
Write
$ 0 = det(M - 2 I) = detmat(1 - 2, 1; a, 6 - 2) = detmat(- 1, 1; a, 4)
  = -4 - a ==> #boxed[$ a=  -4 $]. $

Now let's go back to the characteristic polynomial again.
The eigenvalues are those $lambda$ such that
$ 0 = detmat(1 - lambda, 1; -4, 6 - lambda)
  = (1 - lambda)(6 - lambda) + 4 = lambda^2 - 7 lambda + 10. $
We know that $lambda = 2$ is one root of the quadratic;
the other one is $#boxed[$ lambda = 5 $]$.

To get the eigenvector, write $vec(x,y)$ so that we need
$ M vec(x,y) = 5vec(x,y) ==>
  cases((1-5)x + y = 0, -4+(6-5)y=0) ==> y=4x. $
So an eigenvector for $5$ is $#boxed[$ vec(1,4) $]$ (or any nonzero multiple of it).

#h3[Solution using trace and determinant shortcut]

Let $lambda_2$ be the other eigenvalue.
If you happen to remember that the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues
while the determinant was the product of the eigenvalues (@sec-trace-det),
then this question can be done even more quickly:

$ lambda_2 + 2 = op("Trace") M &= 1 + 6 \
  lambda_2 dot 2 = det M &= detmat(1, 1; a, 6) = 6 - a. $
The first equation implies $lambda_2 = 5$; then the second implies $a = -4$.
The eigenvector is then recovered in the same way as the first solution.

== Solution to @exer-mf-3 (plane)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-3>)

We start by determining the equation of the plane through
$P_1 = (b,0,0)$, $P_2 = (0,b,0)$ and $P_3 = (0,0,b)$.
You might be able to guess the equation just by looking,
but if you didn't see it, you could also use the cross product
$ (P_2 - P_1) times (P_3 - P_1)
  &= vec(-b,b,0) times vec(-b,0,b)
  = vec(b^2, b^2, b^2) = b^2 vec(1,1,1). $
Therefore, $vec(1,1,1)$ is a normal vector to the plane,
so the plane's equation should be $x+y+z = "const"$.
The plane should pass through $(b,0,0)$ and so on; hence the plane's equation is
$ x + y + z = b. $

In order for this to also pass through $(2,3,6)$,
we need $b = 2 + 3 + 6 = #boxed[$ 11 $]$.

It remains to calculate the distance from $(0,0,0)$ to the plane $x+y+z=11$.
If you use the point-to-plane formula (@sec-distance-plane) for this, you get
$ abs(1+2+3-11) / (sqrt(1^2+1^2+1^2)) = #boxed[$ 5/sqrt(3) $]. $

If you didn't remember this formula, you should instead
compute the length of the projection of the vector
$bf(v) = (1,2,3) - (2,3,6) = angle.l -1,-1,-3 angle.r$
(you can replace $(2,3,6)$ with any other point on the plane,
like $(0,0,11)$ or similar) along the direction of $bf(n) = angle.l 1,1,1 angle.r$.
Doing this by hand gives
$ (bf(v) dot bf(n)) / (|bf(n)|)
  = (angle.l -1,-1,-3 angle.r dot angle.l 1,1,1 angle.r) / sqrt(3)
  = -5 / sqrt(3) $
like before, although as I've described before,
we're really just repeating the proof of the point-to-plane formula.

== Solution to @exer-mf-4 (level curves through critical points)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-4>)

Let $f(x,y) = cos(x) + sin(y)$.
The gradient is given by
$ nabla f = angle.l -sin(x), cos(y) angle.r. $
So a critical point occurs at any point for which $sin(x) = cos(y) = 0$.
(These are the points where $cos(x) = pm 1$ and $sin(y) = pm 1$.)

#h3[Saddle point]

To identify a saddle point, we compute the double derivatives:
$ f_(x x) &= -cos(x) \
  f_(x y) &= 0 \
  f_(y y) &= -sin(y). $
It's enough to pick any $(x,y)$ for which $f_(x x)$ and $f_(y y)$ have opposite sign.
One example would be $(x,y) = #boxed[$ (0, (3pi)/2) $]$, among many others.
At this value we get $f(0, (3pi)/2) = 0$.

In fact, the complete list of saddle points is given as follows:
whenever $m$ and $n$ are integers where $m+n$ is odd, the point
$ (x,y) = (m pi, (n + 1/2) pi) $
is a saddle point, and these are all saddle points.
The previous example was the special case $m = 0$ and $n = 1$.

The level curve of $f$ is the set of points $(x,y)$ with $cos(x) + sin(y) = 0$,
so in fact every saddle point lies on this level curve.
In @fig-practice-level-saddle, we draw the level curve below in blue, and the saddle points in red.
Since $cos(x) = sin(y)$ whenever $x pm y + pi/2$ is a multiple of $2 pi$,
the level curves are a mesh of lines running through the plane at diagonals.

  image("figures/practice-level-saddle.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [The level curve of $f = cos(x) + sin(y) =  0$.
    Saddle points are marked in red, and these are all the saddle points.],
) <fig-practice-level-saddle>


#h3[Local maximum]

An example of a local maximum would be $#boxed[$ 0, pi/2 $]$,
at which $f(0, pi/2) = cos 0 + sin (pi/2) = 2$.
In fact, the level curve of $f(x,y) = 2$ passes through all the local maximums,
which occur only when $cos x = sin y = 1$, meaning $x$ and $y-pi/2$ are integer multiples of $2pi$.
So the level curve of $f$ for the value $2$ contains _only_ a disjointed set of points,
as shown in @fig-practice-level-max.

#figure(
  image("figures/practice-level-max.svg", width: auto),

    Each green point is a local maximum of $f$ (and these are the only local maximums).],

== Solution to @exer-mf-5 (optimization)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-5>)

Let $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 4x$.
Let $cal(R)$ denote the region $x^2 + y^2 <= 9$,
which is 2D, has no limit cases, and boundary $x^2 + y^2 = 9$.
We carry out our optimization recipe from @ch-opt.


0. There are no limit cases, but a boundary $x^2 + y^2 = 9$, a circle of radius $3$.

1. First let's find the critical points of $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 4x$.
  Write $ nabla f = vec(2x+4, 4y). $
  The only point at which $nabla f = 0$ is $(-2,0)$, at which $ f(-2,0) = -4. $

2. The boundary of $cal(R)$ is $x^2 + y^2 = 9$.
  We use Lagrange multipliers on the boundary, which we denote $cal(S)$,
  with constraint $g(x,y) = x^2+y^2 = 9$.

  0. The new region $cal(S)$ has no boundary and no limit cases.
  1. Let's find the LM-critical points for $f$ on $cal(S)$.
    Take the gradient of $g$ to get
    $ nabla g = vec(2x, 2y). $
    The only point at which $nabla g = bf(0)$ is $x=y=0$ which isn't on $cal(S)$,
    so we don't have to worry about $nabla g = bf(0)$ the case.
    Now we instead solve
    $ vec(2x+4,4y) = lambda vec(2x, 2y). $
    The second equation says
    $ 4y = lambda 2y ==> lambda = 2 " or " y = 0. $
    If $y = 0$, we get the points $(3,0)$ and $(-3,0)$ which we need to check.
    We have
    $ f(3,0) = 21 \
      f(-3,0) = -3. $
    Now suppose instead $lambda = 2$.
    Then $2x+4 = 4x ==> x = 2$, and hence $y = pm sqrt(5)$.
    We check those points
    $ f(2, sqrt(5)) &= 22 \
      f(2, -sqrt(5)) &= 22. $


  2. $cal(S)$ has no boundary to consider.
  3. $cal(S)$ has no limit cases to consider.

3. $cal(R)$ has no limit cases to consider.

Of the five points we've checked, $#boxed[$ f(-2,0) = -4 $]$
and $#boxed[$ f(2, pm sqrt(5)) = 22 $]$ give the optimal values.

== Solution to @exer-mf-6 (triple integral)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-6>)

The region being integrated over can be succinctly described as
$ cal(R) = { 0 <= x <= y <= z <= 1 }. $
Swap the order of integration so that $z$ is outermost:
$ int_(x=0)^1 int_(y=x)^1 int_(z=y)^1 e^(z^3) dif z dif y dif x
  &= int_(z=0)^1 int_(y=0)^z int_(x=0)^y e^(z^3) dif x dif y dif z \
  &= int_(z=0)^1 e^(z^3) int_(y=0)^z int_(x=0)^y 1 dif x dif y dif z \
  &= int_(z=0)^1 e^(z^3) int_(y=0)^z y dif y dif z \
  &= int_(z=0)^1 e^(z^3) z^2/2 dif y dif z \
  &= 1/6 int_(z=0)^1 e^(z^3) 3z^2 dif y dif z \
  &= 1/6 [e^(z^3)]_(z=0)^1 = #boxed[$ (e-1)/6 $]. $

== Solution to @exer-mf-7 (curl)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-7>)

The curl of $bf(F)$ can be computed as
$ nabla times bf(F)
  = detmat(
    ee_1, ee_2, ee_3;
    partial/(partial x), partial/(partial y), partial/(partial z);
    7 cos(x), cos(y) cos(2z), c sin(y) sin(2z)
  ) = vec(c cos(y) sin(2z) - cos(y) dot (-2sin(2z)), 0, 0) $
which is identically zero only for $#boxed[$ c = -2 $]$.
For that value of $c$, we can recover a potential function $f$ by writing
$ (partial f) / (partial x) &= 7 cos(x) ==> f = 7 sin(x) + C_1(y,z) \
  (partial f) / (partial y) &= cos(y) cos(2z) ==> f = sin(y) cos(2z) + C_2(z,x) \
  (partial f) / (partial z) &= -2 sin(y) sin(2z) ==> f = sin(y) cos(2z) + C_3(x,y). $
Hence, the potential function can be extracted:
$ f(x,y,z) = 7 sin(x) + sin(y) cos(2z). $
For a curve $cal(C)$ starting at $P$ and ending at $Q$, we have
$ int_(cal(C)) f dot dif bf(r) = f(Q) - f(P). $
However, since both the trig functions $sin$ and $cos$ take values in $[-1,1]$,
it's easy to see that $max f = 8$ (for example $f(pi/2, pi/2, 0) = 8$)
while $min f = -8$ (for example $f(-pi/2, -pi/2, 0) = -8$).
Hence the largest possible value of the line integral is $8 - (-8) = #boxed[$ 16 $]$.

== Solution to @exer-mf-8 (flux)

#recall-thm(<exer-mf-8>)

The divergence is
$nabla dot bf(F) =
  partial / (partial x)(x + e^y + z^3)
  + partial / (partial y)(e^x + y + z^3)
  + partial / (partial z) z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. $

Given $cal(S)$, we add two lids, $cal(S)_"top"$ and $cal(S)_"bottom"$.
The top lid is the flat surface given by $z = 9$ and $x^2+y^2 <= 100$,
with normal vector oriented upwards.
The bottom lid is the flat surface given by $z = 7$ and $x^2+y^2 <= 100$,
with normal vector oriented outwards.
Finally, let $cal(T)$ denote the cylinder $1 <= z <= 2$ and $x^2 + y^2 <= 100$,
which is enclosed by $cal(S)$, $cal(S)_"top"$, $cal(S)_"bottom"$.
Then the divergence theorem states that
$ iiint_(cal(T)) nabla dot bf(F) dif V
  = iint_(cal(S)_("top")) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S
  + iint_(cal(S)_("bottom")) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S
  + iint_(cal(S)) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S. $
The fourth quantity is the flux we want,
so our strategy is to calculate the first three quantities.

The divergence is straightforward because its constant:
$ iiint_(cal(T)) nabla dot bf(F) dif V
  = iiint_(cal(T)) 3 dif V = 3 op("Vol")(cal(T)) = 3 dot 100pi dot 2 = 600 pi $
(the volume of a cylinder with height $2$ and base of area $100pi$).

For the top lid, we recall that for a flat surface parallel to the $x y$-plane,
we have $bf(n) dif S = pm angle.l 0,0,1 angle.r dif x dif y$.
For the top lid, we thus have
$ iint_(cal(S)_("top")) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S
  &= iint_(cal(S)_("top")) angle.l x+e^y+729, e^x+y+729, 9 angle.r dot angle.l 0,0,1 angle.r dif x dif y \
  &= iint_(cal(S)_("top")) 9 dif x dif y \
  &= 9 op("Area")(cal(S)_("top")) = 900 pi. $
For the bottom lid, we instead have
$ iint_(cal(S)_("bottom")) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S
  &= iint_(cal(S)_("bottom")) angle.l x+e^y+343, e^x+y+343, 7 angle.r dot angle.l 0,0,-1 angle.r dif x dif y \
  &= iint_(cal(S)_("bottom")) (-7) dif x dif y \
  &= - 7 op("Area")(cal(S)_("bottom")) = - 700 pi. $
Hence, the quantities in the divergence theorem become
$ 600pi = 900pi - 700pi + iint_(cal(S)) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S $
so $iint_(cal(S)) bf(F) dot bf(n) dif S = #boxed[$ 400 pi $]$.
