== [TEXT] Notation for scalars, vectors, points

If you haven't seen the symbol $RR$ before, let's introduce it now:
#definition[
  We denote by $RR$ the real numbers, so $3, sqrt(2), -pi$ are elements of $RR$.
  Sometimes we'll also refer to a real number as a *scalar*.
]
The symbol "$in$", if you haven't seen it before, means "is a member of".
So $3 in RR$ is the statement "$3$ is a real number".
Or $x in RR$ means that $x$ is a real number.

Unfortunately, right off the bat I have to mention that the notation $RR^n$ could mean two things:
#definition[
  By $RR^n$ we could mean one of two things, depending on context:

  - The vectors of length $n$, e.g. the vector $vec(pi, 5)$ is a vector in $RR^2$.
  - The points in $n$-dimensional space, e.g. $(sqrt(2), 7)$ is a point in $RR^2$.
]

To work around the awkwardness of $RR^n$ meaning two possible things,
this book will adopt the following conventions for variable names:

#typesig[
- Bold lowercase letters like $bf(u)$ and $bf(v)$ will be used for vectors.
  When we draw pictures of vectors, we always draw them as _arrows_.

- Capital letters like $P$ and $Q$ are used for points.
  When we draw pictures of points, we always draw them as _dots_.

- Sometimes, if we need to refer to the vector drawn as an arrow
  which starts at point $P$ and ends at $Q$, we write $arrow(P Q)$ for it.
]

We'll also use different notation for actual elements:

#typesig[
- A vector will either be written in column format like $vec(1,2,3)$,
  or with angle brackets as $angle.l 1,2,3 angle.r$ if the column format is too tall to fit.
- But a point will always be written with parentheses like $(1,2,3)$.
]

Some vectors in $RR^3$ are special enough to get their own shorthand.
(The notation "$:=$" means "is defined as".)
#definition[
  When working in $RR^2$, we define
  $ ee_1 := vec(1,0), #h(1em) ee_2 := vec(0,1) $
  and $ bf(0) := vec(0,0). $
]
#definition[
  When working in $RR^3$, we define
  $ ee_1 := vec(1,0,0), #h(1em) ee_2 := vec(0,1,0), #h(1em) ee_3 := vec(0,0,1). $
  We also let $ bf(0) := vec(0,0,0). $

  In other places, you'll sometimes see $bf(i)$, $bf(j)$, $bf(k)$ instead,
  but this book will always use $ee_i$.
]

== [TEXT] Length

#definition[
  The *length* of a vector is denoted by $|bf(v)|$
  and corresponds to the length of the arrow drawn.
  It is given by the Pythagorean theorem.

  - In two dimensions:
    $ bf(v) = vec(x,y) ==> |bf(v)| := sqrt(x^2+y^2). $
  - If three dimensions:
    $ bf(v) = vec(x,y,z) ==> |bf(v)| := sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2). $

  In $n$ dimensions, if $bf(v) = angle.l a_1, ..., a_n angle.r$,
  the length is $|bf(v)| := sqrt(a_1^2 + ... + a_n^2)$.
]

#typesig[
  The length $|bf(v)|$ has type scalar. It is always positive unless $bf(v) = bf(0)$,
  in which case the length is $0$.
]

== [TEXT] Directions and unit vectors

Remember that a vector always has

- both a *magnitude*, which is how long the arrow is in the picture, and
- a *direction*, which refers to which way the arrow points.

In other words, the geometric picture of a vector always carries two pieces of information.
(Here, I'm imagining we've drawn the vector as an arrow
with one endpoint at the origin and pointing some way.)

In a lot of geometry situations we only care about the direction,
and we want to ignore the magnitude.
When that happens, one convention is to just set the magnitude equal to $1$:
#definition[
  A *unit vector* will be a vector that has magnitude $1$.
]
Thus we use the concept of unit vector to capture direction.
So in $RR^2$, $vec(1,0)$ is thought of as "due east"
and $vec(-1,0)$ is "due west", while $vec(0,1)$ is "due north"
and $vec(1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))$ is "northeast".

#definition[
  Given any vector $bf(v)$ in $RR^n$ besides the zero vector,
  the *direction along $bf(v)$* is the unit vector
  $ bf(v) / (|bf(v)|) $
  which is the unit vector that points the same way that $bf(v)$ does.
]
(Depending on what book you're following,
more pedantic authors might write "the unit vector in the direction of $bf(v)$"
or even "the unit vector in the same direction as $bf(v)$"
rather than "direction along $bf(v)$".
This is too long to type, so I adopted the shorter phrasing.
I think everyone will know what you mean.)

We will avoid referring to the direction of the zero-vector $bf(0)$, which doesn't make sense.
(If you try to apply the formula here, you get division by $0$,
since $bf(0)$ is the only vector with length $0$.)
If you need it, the convention is that it has _every_ direction.

#typesig[
  If $bf(v)$ is a nonzero vector in $RR^n$,
  then the direction along $bf(v)$ is a (unit) vector in $RR^n$.
]

#example[
  Let's first do examples in $RR^2$ so we can drawn some pictures.

  - The direction along the vectors $vec(1,0)$, $vec(5,0)$ or $vec(1337,0)$
    are all $vec(1,0)$, thought of as _due east_.

  - But the direction along the vectors $vec(-1,0)$ or $vec(-9,0)$
    are both $vec(-1,0)$, thought of as _due west_.

  - The direction along the vectors $vec(0,-2)$, $vec(0,-17)$
    are all $vec(0,-1)$, thought of as _due south_.
]

#example[
  How about the direction along $vec(3, -4)$?
  We need to first find the length of the vector so we can scale it down.
  That's given by the Pythagorean theorem, of course: $ lr(|vec(3,-4)|) = sqrt(3^2+4^2) = 5. $
  So the direction along $vec(3,-4)$ would be
  $ 1/5 vec(3,-4) =  vec(3 slash 5, -4 slash 5). $
  See @fig-vec-3-4. The direction is somewhere between south and southeast.
]

#figure(
  image("figures/vectors-vec-3-4.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [The direction along $vec(3,-4)$ (blue) is $vec(3 slash 5, -4 slash 5)$ (red).
  Unit vectors always lie on the grey circle (unit circle) by definition.],
) <fig-vec-3-4>

When drawn like @fig-vec-3-4 in the two-dimensional picture $RR^2$,
the notion of direction along $vec(x,y)$
is _almost_ like the notion of slope $y / x$ in high school algebra
(so the slope of the blue ray in @fig-vec-3-4).
But there are a few reasons our notion of direction is more versatile
than just using the slope of the blue ray.

- The notion of direction can tell the difference between $vec(3,-4)$, which goes southeast,
  and $vec(-3,4)$, which goes northwest.
  Slope cannot; it would assign both of these "slope $-4/3$".
- The due-north and due-south directions $vec(0,1)$ and $vec(0,-1)$ would have
  undefined slope due to division-by-zero,
  so you always have to worry about this extra edge case.
  With unit vectors, due-north and due-south don't cause extra headache.
- Our definition of direction works in higher dimension $RR^3$.
  There isn't a good analog of slope there;
  a single number cannot usefully capture a notion of direction in $RR^n$ for $n >= 3$.

#example[
  The direction along the three-dimensional vector $vec(12, -16, 21)$
  is $ vec(12 slash 29, -16 slash 29, 21 slash 29). $
  See if you can figure out where the $29$ came from.

== [RECIPE] Areas and volumes <sec-det-area-vol>

If $bf(v)_1 = vec(x_1, y_1)$ and $bf(v)_2 = vec(x_2, y_2)$ are vectors,
drawn as arrows with a common starting point,
then their sum $bf(v)_1 + bf(v)_2$ makes a parallelogram in the plane with $bf(0)$
as shown in @fig-parallelogram.

#figure(
  image("figures/vectors-area.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [Vector addition in $RR^2$.],
) <fig-parallelogram>

The following theorem is true, but we won't be able to prove it in 18.02.

#recipe(title: [Recipe for area of a parallelogram])[
  The signed area of the parallelogram formed by
  $bf(v)_1 = vec(x_1, y_1)$ and $bf(v)_2 = vec(x_2, y_2)$ is equal to
  $ detmat(x_1, x_2; y_1, y_2) = x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1. $
]

A similar theorem is true for the parallelepiped#footnote[I hate trying to spell this word.]
with three vectors in $RR^3$; see @fig-parallelepiped.

#recipe(title: [Recipe for volume of a parallelepiped])[
  The signed volume of the parallelepiped formed by
  $bf(v)_1 = vec(x_1, y_1, z_1)$,
  $bf(v)_2 = vec(x_2, y_2, z_2)$,
  $bf(v)_3 = vec(x_3, y_3, z_3)$
  is equal to
  $ detmat(x_1, x_2, x_3; y_1, y_2, y_3; z_1, z_2, z_3). $
]

#figure(
  image("figures/vectors-parallelepiped.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [Three vectors in $RR^3$ making a parallelepiped.],
) <fig-parallelepiped>

You might noticed that the word "signed" has slipped in before "area" and "volume".
What does that mean?
Well, if you only care about the area of the volume itself,
it doesn't matter for you; you should just take the absolute value of the determinant.
But the sign carries a bit more information.

- In 2D, consider the angle between $bf(v)_1$ and $bf(v)_2$,
  between $0 degree$ and $180 degree$.
  Then we consider the sign to be $+$
  if the angle goes counterclockwise from $bf(v)_1$ to $bf(v)_2$,
  (like the example in @fig-parallelogram), and negative otherwise.
  So in @fig-parallelogram, we would have
  $ detmat(x_1, x_2; y_1, y_2) = +"area", #h(1em)
    detmat(x_2, x_1; y_2, y_1) = -"area". $

- In 3D, the convention follows the right-hand rule:
  suppose vectors $bf(v)_1$, $bf(v)_2$, $bf(v)_3$ are given it that order.
  Curl the fingers of your right hand from $bf(v)_1$ to $bf(v)_2$;
  then the signed volume is positive if your thumb points in the direction of $bf(v)_3$
  (as in @fig-parallelepiped, for example) and negative otherwise.

#digression[
  If you're interested in the proof of these results
  and their $n$-dimensional generalizations, the tool needed is the *wedge product*,
  which is denoted $ and.big^k (RR^n). $
  This is well beyond the scope of 18.02,
  but it's documented in Chapter 12 of my #link("https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html")[Napkin]
  for those of you that want to read about it.

  Alternatively, I think Wikipedia and Axler#footnote[Who
    has a paper called #link("https://www.axler.net/DwD.html")[Down with Determinants!],
    which I approve of.
  ], among others,
  use a definition of the determinant as
  the unique multilinear alternating map on $n$-tuples of column vectors in $RR^n$
  that equals $1$ for the identity.
  This definition will work, and will let you derive the formula for determinant,
  and gives you a reason to believe it should match your concept of area and volume.
  It's probably also easier to understand than wedge products.
  However, in the long term I think wedge products are more versatile,
  even though they take much longer to setup.
