== Solution to @exer-slicing-standard (practice with slicing)

#recall-thm(<exer-slicing-standard>)

Let $cal(R)$ be the region bounded by the curves $y = sqrt(x)$ and $y = x^3$.
We wish to compute the integral
$ I = iint_(cal(R)) x^(100) y^(200) dif x dif y . $

To determine the limits of integration,
we find the intersection points by solving $sqrt(x) = x^3$
Squaring both sides gives $x = x^6 ==> x(x^5-1) = 0$, so $x=0$ or $x=1$.
That is, the intersection points are $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$.
A sketch of the region is shown in @fig-sol-golf-double-sol1.

  image("figures/sol-golf-double-sol1.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [The region between $y = sqrt(x)$ and $y = x^3$.],
) <fig-sol-golf-double-sol1>

From the figure, we can describe the region $cal(R)$ with the inequalities
$ 0 <= x^3 <= y <= sqrt(x) <= 1. $

#h3[Integrating with $x$ inside and $y$ outside]

The values of $y$ go from $0$ to $1$.
For each fixed $y$, the values of $x$ range from
$ y^2 <= x <= y^(1\/3) $
so the integral is:
$ I = int_(y = 0)^1 int_(x = y^2)^(y^(1 \/ 3)) x^(100) y^(200) dif x dif y . $
Evaluating the inner integral:
$ int_(x = y^2)^(y^(1 \/ 3)) x^100 dif x = [x^101 / 101]_(x = y^2)^(y^(1\/3))
  = y^(101 \/ 3) / 101 - y^202 / 101 . $
Now, integrating over $y$:
$ I &= int_(y = 0)^1 (y^(101 \/ 3) / 101 - y^202 / 101) y^200 dif y \
    &= 1 / 101 (int_(y=0)^1 y^(701\/3) dif y - int_(y=0)^1 y^(402) dif y) \
    &= 1 / 101 (3/704 - 1/403) = #boxed[$ 5 / 283712 $]. $

#h3[Integrating with $y$ inside and $x$ outside]

The values of $x$ go from $0$ to $1$.
For a fixed $x$, the values of $y$ range from
$ x^3 <= y <= x^(1\/2) $
so the integral is
$ I = int_(x = 0)^1 int_(y = x^3)^(x^(1 \/ 2)) x^(100) y^(200) dif y dif x . $

Evaluating the inner integral:
$ int_(y = x^3)^(sqrt(x)) y^200 dif y = [y^201 / 201]_(y = x^3)^(y = sqrt(x))
  = x^(201\/2) / 201 - x^603 / 201 . $
Now, integrating over $x$:
$ I &= int_(x = 0)^1 x^100 (x^(201\/2) / 201 - x^603 / 201) dif x \
  &= 1/201 (int_(x=0)^1 x^(401\2) dif x - int_(x=0)^1 x^(703) dif x) \
  &= 1/201 (2/403 - 1/704) = #boxed[$ 5 / 283712 $]. $

== Solution to @exer-slicing-mass (center of mass of a region)

#recall-thm(<exer-slicing-mass>)

The region is really similar to the one in the preceding exercise, and can be described as
$ 0 <= x^2 <= y <= sqrt(x) <= 1 $
for the same reason, as shown in @fig-sol-golf-double-sol2.
(It's exactly the same as the last exercise except $x^3$ was changed to $x^2$,
so one just replaces all the $3$'s with $2$'s.)
Note that the region is symmetric around the line $y = x$,
so _a priori_ we should expect our answer to lie on $y = x$ as well.

#figure(
  image("figures/sol-golf-double-sol2.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [The region between $y=sqrt(x)$ and $y=x^2$.],
) <fig-sol-golf-double-sol2>

First, to compute the area of $cal(R)$, we can write
$ op("Area")(cal(R)) = int_(x = 0)^1 int_(y=x^2)^(sqrt(x)) 1 dif y dif x
  = int_(x=0)^1 (sqrt(x) - x^2) dif x
  = [2/3 x^(3\/2) - 1/3 x^3]_(x=0)^1 = 1/3. $

The $x$-coordinate of the center of mass is therefore given by
$ dash(x) = 1 / (op("Area")(cal(R))) int_(cal(R)) x dif A
  &= 1 / (1\/3) int_(x = 0)^1 int_(y=x^2)^(sqrt(x)) x dif y dif x \
  &= 3 int_(x = 0)^1 x (sqrt(x) - x^2) dif x \
  &= 3 [2/5 x^(5/2) - 1/4 x^4]_(x=0)^1 = 9/20. $

As for the $y$-coordinate, we expect $dash(y) = dash(x)$ from the symmetry of the region, and indeed
$ dash(y) = 1 / (op("Area")(cal(R))) int_(cal(R)) y dif A
  &= 1 / (1\/3) int_(x = 0)^1 int_(y=x^2)^(sqrt(x)) y dif y dif x \
  &= 3 int_(x = 0)^1 [y^2/2]_(y=x^2)^(sqrt(x)) dif x \
  &= 3/2 int_(x = 0)^1 (x-x^4) dif x \
  &= 3/2 [1/2 x^(2) - 1/5 x^5]_(x=0)^1 = 9/20. $

Thus, the center of mass of the region is: $ #boxed[$ (9/20, 9/20) $]. $

== Solution to @exer-swapint-fifth (double integral with 5th root)

#recall-thm(<exer-swapint-fifth>)

Writing as a region, this is
$ cal(R) = cases(0 <= y <= 1, y <= x <= root(5, y)). $
The values of $x$ could range anywhere in $0 <= x <= 1$.
For a fixed $x$, the value $y$ needs to satisfy four conditions: $0 <= y <= 1$
and also $x^5 <= y <= x$.
But in fact $ 0 <= x^5 <= y <= x <= 1 $
so we can compress this to just:
$ cal(R) = cases(0 <= x <= 1, x^5 <= y <= x). $
Thus, the new limits of integration become:
$ int_(x = 0)^1 int_(y = x^5)^x (x y^2) / (1 - x^12) dif y dif x $

We now compute the inner integral with respect to $y$:
$ int_(y = x^5)^x y^2 dif y = [y^3 / 3]_(y = x^5)^(y = x) $
Substituting the limits of integration:
$ 1 / 3 (x^3 - (x^5)^3) = 1 / 3 (x^3 - x^15) $

Now substitute this result into the outer integral:
$ int_(x = 0)^1 (x) / (1 - x^12) dot 1 / 3 (x^3 - x^15) dif x $
Simplifying:

$ 1 / 3 int_(x = 0)^1 (x) / (1 - x^12) (x^3 - x^15) dif x
  &= 1 / 3 int_(x = 0)^1 (x^4 - x^16) / (1 - x^12) dif x \
  &= 1/3 int_(x = 0)^1 x^4 dif x \
  &= 1/3 (1/5 - 0) = 1/15. $

== Solution to @exer-rat-slice (rational integral)

#recall-thm(<exer-rat-slice>)

For brevity, let $N := 999^5$.

At face value, this looks like an 18.01 integral,
but we know from 18.01 that this integral is actually measuring the area under some curve.
The idea is that, to avoid having to deal with the hideous roots,
we are going to use horizontal slicing for the region under the curve shown in the figure.

#figure(
  image("figures/practice-undergraph.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [The region $0 <= y <= root(5, root(3,x) + 1)$ for $0 <= x <= N$. Not at all to scale.],
)

Let's first convert the region into inequality format: we have $0 <= x <= N$, $y >= 0$ and
$ y <= root(3, root(5, x) + 1) <==> x >= (y^3-1)^5. $
Hence, the area under the curve can be split into two parts.
In the range $0 <= y <= 1$ we get the light blue rectangle shown above (bottom half of figure),
which goes from $0 <= x <= N$ to $0 <= y <= 1$, and has area $N$.
Then from $1 <= y <= 10$ the bounds on $x$ are instead given by
$ (y^3-1)^5 <= x <= N. $
This is the dark blue region (top half of figure) and it has area
$ int_(y=1)^2 int_(x = (y^3-1)^5)^N 1 dif x dif y = int_(y=1)^N (N - (y^3-1)^5) dif y. $
The total area is thus
$ N + int_(y=1)^(10) (N - (y^3-1)^5) dif y
  = N + N(N-1) - int_(y=1)^(10) (y^3-1)^5 dif y. $
This is a easily seen to be a rational number.
#remark[
  Using a calculator, one could explicitly compute
  $ int_(y=1)^(10) (y^3-1)^5 dif y
  = int_(y=1)^(10) (y^(15) - 5y^(12) + 10y^9 - 10y^6 + 5y^3 - 1) dif y
  = 904414539218186169/1456 $
  if one is so inclined.

#digression[
  It is possible to evaluate the integral using 18.01 methods
  by making the $u$-substitution $u = x^(1/5)+1$, but this is fairly tedious.

== Solution to @exer-chvar-triangle (integral over triangle)

#recall-thm(<exer-chvar-triangle>)

We use the transformation: $ u = x + y , quad v = x / y . $
The region under $(u,v)$ coordinates can be expressed as
$ 0 <= u <= 3, quad 1/2 <= v <= 2. $
This is drawn in @fig-sol-golf-triangle.

#figure(
  image("figures/sol-golf-triangle.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [The triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,2)$, and $(2,1)$,
    with a change of variables suggested using $u = x+y$ and $v = x/y$],
) <fig-sol-golf-triangle>

This is a case where we want to use the inverse Jacobian
$ det (J_(bf(T)^(-1))) = detmat(
    (partial u)/(partial x), (partial u)/(partial y);
    (partial v)/(partial x), (partial v)/(partial y)
  ) = detmat(
    1, 1;
    1/y, -x/y^2
  ) = -(x+y) / y^2. $
So
$ 1 / (|det (J_(bf(T)^(-1)))|) = y^2 / (x+y). $

Hence, the transformed integral becomes
$
  int_(u=0)^3 int_(v=1/2)^2 (x+y)^2 / (x y) dot y^2 / (x+y) dif v dif u
  &= int_(u=0)^3 int_(v=1/2)^2 y/x dot (x+y) dif v dif u \
  &= int_(u=0)^3 int_(v=1/2)^2 1/v dot u dif v dif u \
  &= (int_(u=0)^3 u dif u)(int_(v=1/2)^2 1/v dif v) \
  &= [u^2/2]_(u=0)^3 dot [log v]_(v=1/2)^2 \
  &= 9/2 dot (log 2 - log (1/2)) = #boxed[$ 9 log 2 $].
$

== Solution to @exer-polar1 (polar integral 1)

#recall-thm(<exer-polar1>)

The limits of integration describe the region bounded by:
- $0 <= x <= 1$,
- $0 <= y <= sqrt(1 - x^2)$.
This corresponds to the quarter-circle in the first quadrant of the unit
disk, given by $x^2 + y^2 <= 1$ with $x >= 0$.

Using the polar coordinate transformations:
$ x = r cos theta , quad y = r sin theta , quad dif x dif y = r dif r dif theta . $
The given region corresponds to:
- $0 <= r <= 1$,
- $0 <= theta <= pi / 2$.
Rewriting the integrand:
$ x y = (r cos theta) (r sin theta) = r^2 cos theta sin theta . $

Hence the integral transforms into:
$ I &= int_(theta = 0)^(pi \/ 2) int_(r = 0)^1 r^2 cos theta sin theta dot r dif r dif theta \
  &= (int_(r=0)^1 r^3 dif r) (int_(theta = 0)^(pi \/ 2) sin(2theta)/2 dif theta) \
  &= [r^4/4]_(r=0)^1 [-cos(2theta)/4]_(theta=0)^(pi\/2) \
  &= 1/4 dot 1/2 = #boxed[$ 1/8 $]. $

== Solution to @exer-polar2 (polar integral 2)

#recall-thm(<exer-polar2>)

In @sec-offset-circle, we have already established that the given region in polar
coordinates is described by:
$ 0 <= r <= 2 cos theta , quad - pi / 2 <= theta <= pi / 2 . $
Using the standard polar transformations:
$ x = r cos theta , quad y = r sin theta , quad dif x dif y = r dif r dif theta , $
the given integrand is just $r$.
$ 1 / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1 / sqrt(r^2) = 1 / r . $
Thus, the integral
becomes:
$ I &= int_(theta = - pi \/ 2)^(pi \/ 2) int_(r = 0)^(2 cos theta) 1 / r dot r dif r dif theta \
  &= int_(theta = - pi \/ 2)^(pi \/ 2) int_(r = 0)^(2 cos theta) dif r dif theta \
  &= int_(theta = - pi \/ 2)^(pi \/ 2) 2 cos theta dif theta \
  &= [2 sin theta]_(theta = - pi \/ 2)^(pi \/ 2) \
  &= #boxed[$ 4 $]. $

== Solution to @exer-polar3 (polar integral 3)

#recall-thm(<exer-polar3>)

This is actually a disguised version of the example in @sec-offset-circle!
That is, the answer is also $32/9$.

To repeat, in @sec-offset-circle the example can be thought of as showing
$ I_1 = iint_((x-1)^2 + y^2 <= 1) sqrt(x^2+y^2) dif x dif y = 32/9. $
Our goal is to argue that
$ I_2 = iint_(x^2+y^2 <= 1) sqrt((x+3/5)^2 + (y+4/5)^2) dif x dif y = #boxed[$ 32/9 $]. $

Note that:
- The first integral $I_1$ is taken over the disk centered at $(1 , 0)$ with radius 1.
  We call this disk $cal(R)_1$.
- The second integral $I_2$ is taken over the unit disk centered at $(0 , 0)$.
  We call this disk $cal(R)_2$.

Observe that the disks $cal(R)_1$ and $cal(R)_2$ are congruent.
Moreover,

- The integrand in $I_1$ is $sqrt(x^2 + y^2)$.
  This measures the distance of each point in $cal(R)_1$ from the origin $O = (0 , 0)$.
  Note that $O$ is a point on the boundary of $cal(R)_1$.
- The integrand in $I_2$ is $sqrt((x + 3 / 5)^2 + (y + 4 / 5)^2)$.
  This measures the distance of each point in $cal(R)_2$ from the origin $P = (-3/5, -4/5)$.
  Note that $P$ is a point on the boundary of $cal(R)_2$.

See the illustration in @fig-sol-golf-polar.

#figure(
  image("figures/sol-golf-polar.svg", width: auto),
  caption: [Illustration of the integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ of
    from @sec-offset-circle and @exer-polar3, showing they're computing the same thing.],
) <fig-sol-golf-polar>

Since both integrals effectively compute the same function over congruent regions,
the results must be equal.
