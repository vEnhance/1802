# Evan's 18.02 Materials from Fall 2024

18.02 is multivariable calculus at MIT.

Originally, this was a repository for [DLC](https://w.wiki/B6m3)'s
that I wrote when teaching 18.02 recitation.
Gradually, it involved into a separate textbook by me,
because I was dissatisfied with the textbook provided by the actual course.

The outputted textbook can be downloaded at the following link:

For other historical pieces,
see the [18.02 recitation page on evanchen.cc](https://web.evanchen.cc/1802.html).
